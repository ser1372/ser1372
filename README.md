## Hi, my name is Sergey, and I'm a Full-stack developer. My stack is PHP, JS, Ajax, Vue.js, Laravel,
  HTML and CSS. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and trying to learn something new every
  day in the world of web development.
  I have a little more than six months of commercial experience and during that time I've managed to
  participate in several projects which helped me develop and improve my skills. I am confident that
  my experience and knowledge will help me to solve problems and create high-quality products. I am
  always ready for new challenges and try not to stop on my laurels. If you have any questions or
  suggestions, I am always open for communication and ready to cooperate!
